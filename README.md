Intro to Machine Learning

Traditionally enable computer/machine program which learns from experience is called a machine learning program.

Branch of ML

Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning, Reinforcement learning and Semi-supervised learning.


Classification: When inputs are divided into two or more classes, the learner must produce a model that assigns unseen inputs to one or more (multi-label classification) of these classes. This is typically tackled in a supervised way. Spam filtering is an example of classification, where the inputs are email (or other) messages and the classes are “spam” and “not spam”.
Regression: Which is also a supervised problem, A case when the outputs are continuous rather than discrete.
Clustering: When a set of inputs is to be divided into groups. Unlike in classification, the groups are not known beforehand, making this typically an unsupervised task.
